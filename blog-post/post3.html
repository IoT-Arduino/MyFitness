                <p>The following equipment is required for muscle training at home.</p>

                <h3 class="post">Dumbbell</h3>
                <p>Recently, a type that can switch weight with one touch has appeared. The price is high, but the big advantage is that there is no hassle to switch weights.</p>

                <h3 class="post">Bench</h3>
                <p>There are two types of benches: an incline bench that can change the angle and a flat bench that does not change the angle.Each has its own merits and demerits.</p>

                <h4>Incline bench</h4>
                <p>Advantages:  Compatible with many types of muscle training menus.<br />
                    Disadvantage: expensive, heavy, take up space.</p>

                <h4>Flat bench</h4>
                <p>Advantage:  Low price. It is light and does not take up space.<br />
                    Disadvantage: Few types of muscle training menus can be supported.</p>

                <h2 class="post">Training menu</h2>

                <p>Relationship between training frequency and load:
                Increasing the number of times with a lightweight does not increase muscle mass.
                The weight should be so heavy that it cannot be more than 10 times. And do more than 3 sets with this weight.
                The number of times may be reduced as if the first set 10 times, the second set 9 times, the third set 8 times. It is important to try to the limit without leaving any surplus.</p>

                <p>Also, it is necessary to have a proper break so that training is not overdone.</p>

                <p>Against this background, the idea of ​​a division method has been developed in which the parts to be trained are divided by day.
                There are several ways to divide, such as separating the upper body and lower body or separating pressing training from pulling training.</p>

                <p>Also, when training, you need to be aware that you don't give a reaction and that you slowly move your weights and put a load on your muscles.</p>
